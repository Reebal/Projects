Hey all,

This is project done specifically to demostrate data cleaning, and exploration in MySQL. I have covered concepts like,

- Importing database into MySQL,
- Data cleaning (removing duplicates, handling nulls and blanks, standardizing data, removing unnecessary columns)
- Data exploration using concepts like sub-queries, joins, window functions and aggregate functions
- Data visualization in Tableau. 

1. Go through the data_cleaning_exploration.pdf to know in detail (step by step) about this project
2. Download the layoffs.csv, and the .sql files to try running the project
3. An image of the dashboard built using Tableau is also available
