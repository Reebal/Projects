**Comparative Analysis of Healthcare Access and Utilization Among Children with Public vs. Private Insurance (2021-2022)**

**Introduction:** This analysis compares the health benefits and challenges faced by children with public versus private insurance using data from the Child & Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative (CAHMI) for 2021 and 2022. CAHMI's dataset includes comprehensive information on children's demographics, family background, community, health, and geographic factors. This study focuses on healthcare coverage, access, quality of care, and basic demographics.

**Data Exploration:** dataset includes details on children insured by public, private, both, or neither insurance types. For this analysis, only public and private insurance data is considered.

**Data Cleaning (Python):**

- Imported dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Reviewed data types and checked for missing values.
- Replaced '?' with NaN.
- Created a bar plot to compare insurance types using matplotlib.
- Filtered dataset for public and private insurance only. Cleaned dataset is available as `filtered_data.xlsx`.

**Data Manipulation (Excel)**

- Utilized pivot tables and slicers to compare healthcare services (General Medical Care, Dental Care, Eye Care) for public vs. private insurance.
- Created 2D column charts and added slicers for dynamic filtering by insurance type.

**Data Visualization:** Consolidated pivot tables and charts into a dynamic dashboard for interactive comparison between public and private insurance types.

**Important Takeaways**

1. **Healthcare Services**: Private insurance generally leads to more consistent general medical care, while public insurance offers better access to dental and eye care.
2. **Preventive Care**: Higher percentage of private insurance participants received preventive care.
3. **Employment Status**: Influences insurance choice; higher-income families tend toward private insurance.
4. **Unmet Needs**: Private insurance participants report fewer unmet healthcare needs and frustrations.
5. **Family-Centered Care**: Better experiences reported by private insurance participants.
6. **Mental Healthcare**: Easier access with private insurance.
7. **COVID-19 Impact**: Private insurance provided better access to video/phone consultations, while public insurance had better childcare availability.

**Conclusion:** The analysis highlights significant differences in healthcare access and utilization between public and private insurance. While private insurance generally offers more comprehensive care, public insurance has specific advantages, particularly in dental and eye care. Employment status affects insurance choice, and overall, private insurance provides better access and fewer frustrations, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
