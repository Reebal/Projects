1.	I explored the primary dataset PBJ and wrote potential questions that can be answered to help recommend the sales leadership team at company XYZ.
2.	As it was a large dataset, I decided to use SQL to manipulate the data as the querying process, and load time will be quick. 
3.	For the 5th recommendation, I worked with the “NH_Penalties_Aug2024” dataset in Excel. I built a pivot table to get the top 10 nursing home providers who have been fined the largest percentage of penalties in the 1st Quarter of 2024. 
4.	I aggregated all of the resulting data in Tableau and built a interactive visualization as well.
