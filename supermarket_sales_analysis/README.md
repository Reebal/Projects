# Supermarket Sales Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a Python notebook for analyzing supermarket sales data using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scipy
I also created an interactive dashboard in Microsoft Power BI to explore how the findings from this analysis can be put into one single dashboard.

## Analysis

The analysis answers the below questions:

1. What is the total percentage of sales by each branch?
2. What is the total percentage of sales by each product line?
3. Which product line has the most and least sales? Find this for each branch.
4. Is there a difference in gross income by members compared to non-members? A/B test to find out.
5. What is the weekly analysis of total sales of each product line? Identify trends.
6. What is the weekly analysis of total sales of each branch? Identify trends.
7. Determine which product lines are performing well in terms of customer ratings.
