Analyzing the Gender Gap in Undergraduate Degrees

I have incorporated concepts like interactive plots using Plotly Dash and multithreading with Flask.

1. I visualized the comparison between degrees earned by women and men (100 - number of degrees earned by women) in line charts. These line charts can be viewed by choosing the appropriate category and degree from radio items.
   
2. The average of degrees earned by women and men is ranked in descending order in an interactive bar graph with sliders. You can slide right and left to see as many ranks as you want.
